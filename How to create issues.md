# How to create an issue

In order to easy keep track of the work we will create issues for each task that we are working with. 

## Big tasks

If the task that you are working with is so big and you need to create some other smaller ones. You will need to create the smaller one and go to the bigger and paste the link to it as a sub-task.
The bigger tasks could start with __[US]__ meanning that is a __U__ser __H__istory. For example:

- [US] create volunteer (issue-1)
    - create form (issue-3)
    - create endpoint to store the data (issue-7)
    - update endpoint collection (issue-8)
